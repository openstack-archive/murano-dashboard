      descriptionTitle: Passwords
      description: >-
        Windows requires strong password for service administration.
        Your password should have at least one letter in each 
        register, a number and a special character. Password length should be 
        a minimum of 7 characters.

        Once you forget your password you won't be able to 
        operate  the service until recovery password would be entered. So it's 
        better for Recovery and Administrator password to be different.
